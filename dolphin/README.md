Dolphin integration
===================

Thanks to [Miguel Marco](https://riemann.unizar.es/~mmarco/), here is an neat
integration for [Dolphin](https://kde.org/applications/system/org.kde.dolphin),
the KDE file manager:

1. Add the `mat2.desktop` file either in
	- `/usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/` to install it globally
	- `~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/` for a specific user
2. Run `kbuildsycoca5` to update the corresponding database
3. Enjoy your new contextual menu to remove metadata from your files!
